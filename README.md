# Horiseon SEO Refactor Challenge

## Description

In this web application I was tasked with refactoring existing code while prioritizing SEO (Search Engine Optimization), accessibility, and the existing functionality of the code. Previously the code contained multiple div tags that decreased its SEO. While div tags aren't inherently bad there are many new tags to better describe the content of your code. Therefore new tags were used to replace the old div tags to increase SEO.In addition, Alt tags were added to images to improve accessibility for users. Alt tags essentially describe the image it's attached to. This allows for the website to be accessible to a larger audience since the tags can be used with programs that aid the visually impaired. Through this challenge I have gained experience in refactoring code which is an important skill that I will use as an entry level developer. Additionally through this challenge I was able to increase my exposure with HTML, CSS, and Git allowing me to practice and build upon the knowledge I have gained throughout the first week of bootcamp.
